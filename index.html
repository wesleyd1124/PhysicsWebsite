                                        <p><strong>Usually the first thing that is needed when solving any collision problem is determining what type of collision it is. If it is an elastic collision then that means that both objects retain seperate masses and speeds. An elastic collision generally uses the following equation: <i>(m1 • v1) + (m2 • v2) = (m1 • v1) + (m2 • v2)</i>. If the collision is an inelastic one then the following equation is usually used: <i>(m1 • v1) + (m2 • v2) = (m1 + m2) • v</i>. From there it is as simple as plugging all the variables in and solving.</strong></p>

                                            <strong><p>     For the lab for the Momentum Unit we were required to design an experiment to determine the momentum of carts before and after an elastic collision, an inelastic collision and an explosion. This meant we needed to measure the speed of the carts by seeing how fast they got to each other and how fast they went afterwards. For the elastic collision we just pushed one cart strong enough onto the other and observed as the one with more momentum pushed through the other. For the inelastic collision we needed to move both carts in a way that they would bounce off of each other and we measured from there. Finally the explosion was the most difficult because it required we put the carts together and put a loaded spring in between them, we then activated the spring which pushed the carts apart (The momentum ended up being zero in the system because they went from being still to moving in opposite directions at the same speed). Overall the conclusion was that little momentum was lost in any collision and the momentum that was lost can be attributed to friction.</p></strong>

                                        <p class=""><strong>Momentum and Impulse have plenty of real life application and most of them are pretty intuitive. Here are some pretty common examples:<br><br>•A bowling ball rolled with a greater speed than another with the same weight will have a greater momentum. Alternatively, a bowling ball with a greater weight moving at the same speed will also have a greater momentum.<br>•Airbags are designed to make collisions longer so that it takes away the force of the momentum. This goes back to the whole concept of Big F Little T (Big Force, Little Time) and Big T Little F (Big Time, Little Force).<br>•Boxers are told to relax their neck to increase collision time. They are also told to make contact as quick as possible with their punches so the time is less and the force is greater.<br>•In football it it easier to run people over when they are standing still because their momentum is effectively zero.</strong></p>

Mr. H asks Suzie (44 kg) to sit on a second 14-kg skate cart. The two carts are placed on low friction boards in the hallway. Jerome pushes off of Suzie's cart. Measurements are made to determine that Suzie's cart acquired a post-impulse speed of 9.6 m/s. Determine the expected recoil speed of Jerome and Michael's cart.</p>
